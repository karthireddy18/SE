Task 1: Pushing multi-folder project into private repository( Note: student take screenshots for upload).
1. Create a Private Repository on GitHub
•	Go to https://github.com
•	Click 
•	New repository
•	Give it a name
•	Check Private
•	Click Create repository
 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Project (if not already done)
     Open a terminal in the root of your multi-folder project:
  	cd /path/to/your/project
  	git init
3. Add the Remote Repository (in bash)
You’ll see a URL on GitHub after creating the repo. It will look as below , run  this command in git bash:
	git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-private-repo.git
4. Add and Commit Your Files(in bash)
	git add .
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. Push to the Private Repository 
If the repo is new and empty, push like this from git bash:
	git push -u origin master
If you're using the main branch (GitHub default):
	git push -u origin main
You may be prompted to log in (via username/password or token).

Task 2: Students must explore all listed git commands on the multi-folder project in local and remote repository.
1.	Git  Commands:
●	git version : The command git version is used to check the version of git. 
git --version
•	git config: Configures Git settings. Commonly used to set up user information
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
•	git config --list: Displays all the Git configurations for the current user.
2.	 Repository Management
•	git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
git init
•	git clone:  Creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine
	git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
•	git remote –v : To see the remote repository that is connected to your local repository
 git remote –v

•	git remote add : To add a new remote repository to your local repository
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git


•	Pushing Changes to Remote: To push your local commits to a remote repository:

         git push <remote_name> <branch_name>

		git push origin main

•	Pulling Updates from Remote: To pull the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch
          git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>

          git pull origin main


•	git remote remove: To remove a remote repository from your local configuration:

            git remote remove <remote_name>

         git remote remove origin
•	Renaming a Remote:  to rename an existing remote: 

         git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>

	  git remote rename origin upstream

•	Fetching Updates from Remote: To fetch updates from the remote repository but not merge them into your local branch

	git fetch <remote_name>

•	Changing Remote URL : To change the URL of a remote (e.g., after changing the remote repository address):
	git remote set-url <remote_name> <new_url>

            git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repository.git

•	Viewing the Remote Repository’s Information: to see detailed information about a remote repository

            git remote show <remote_name>

            git remote show origin


3. Staging and Committing
•	git status: Shows the status of changes in your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files are untracked, modified, or ready to be committed.
git status
•	git add: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
git add filename.txt   # Adds a specific file
git add .              # Adds all changes in the directory
•	git commit: Commits the staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message. The -m option allows you to include a commit message.
git commit -m "Commit message describing changes"
4. Branching and Merging
•	git branch: Lists all branches or creates a new branch
git branch                # Lists all branches or
git branch -a               # Lists all branches
git branch branch-name    # Creates a new branch
git branch -d <branch_name>    # Deletes a branch
                        Use -D to force-delete if it hasn't been merged.
•	Listing All Remote Branches :  To you want to list all branches on the remote repository
         git branch –r

•	git checkout: Switches to a different branch
git checkout branch-name  # Switches to an existing branch
git checkout -b new-branch # Creates and switches to a new branch
•	Pruning Deleted Remotes : If a branch was deleted on the remote but still shows up locally.
   git remote prune origin

When someone deletes a branch on the remote, your local Git doesn’t automatically remove the corresponding remote-tracking branch (like origin/old-feature).
git remote prune origin removes these outdated references.

•	Fetching a Specific Remote Branch: To fetch a specific branch from a remote.
     git fetch <remote_name> <branch_name>

	    git fetch origin feature-branch

•	Setting the Upstream Branch for Pushing : When pushing for the first time and want to set the remote branch you are pushing to:

	git push --set-upstream <remote_name> <branch_name>

       git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch

•	git merge: Merges the specified branch into the current branch. This command integrates the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.
git checkout main         # Switch to the main branch
git merge branch-name     # Merge branch-name into main
•	Rebasing a Local Branch onto a Remote Branch: If you want to rebase your local branch onto a remote branch (this can be useful to keep your history linear)
	git fetch <remote_name>
	git rebase <remote_name>/<branch_name>
Example:
	git fetch origin
	git rebase origin/main

5.	Undoing Changes

•	git reset : Removes the specified file from the staging area but leaves the working directory unchanged. git reset --hard can also reset the working directory and staging area to the last commit.
git reset <file>:
•	git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified commit, leaving the history intact.
git revert <commit>:
6.	Viewing History

•	git log: Shows a history of commits in the repository, including commit hashes, messages, and timestamps. Use git log --oneline for a more concise view.
		git log:
•	git diff: Displays differences between various commits, the working directory, and the staging area. git diff without arguments shows changes not yet staged.
git diff:
•	git show:  Shows the details of a specific commit, including the changes made and the commit message.
git show <commit>
7.	To undo the changes made to file before staging it.

•	git restore filename
8.	To correct committed with the wrong message
•	git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"

9. Recovering deleted branches

•	git reflog
•	git checkout -b feature-ui <commit_hash>

10. To download the latest changes from the remote without merging
•	git fetch origin

11. To remove accidentally committed  sensitive file from Git history.

•	git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
•	"git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch secrets.txt" \
•	--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

12. To merge changes from another branch
First switch to branch where changes are to applied and then merge another-branch
•	git checkout previous-branch
•	git merge another-branch

13. To resolve a merge conflict manually
You tried to merge two branches and Git reported a conflict in x.js. Then for conflict resolution do:
1.	Open x.js and resolve/remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
2.	After resolving:
	git add app.js
	git commit  # If Git didn’t auto-create a merge commit

14. The .gitignore
The .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. It's a useful way to avoid committing unnecessary files like log files, build outputs, and IDE configurations. 
a.	 Create a .gitignore File
In the root directory of your Git project, create a file called .gitignore 
touch .gitignore
b.	 Add Rules to .gitignore
Inside the .gitignore file, you add patterns for the files and directories you want Git to ignore. Each pattern should be written on a new line.
Here are some common examples:
•	Ignore all .log files:    *.log
•	Ignore a specific file:     secret_file.txt
•	Ignore all files in a temp/ directory:        temp/
•	Ignore all files except important_file.txt inside a folder:
folder/*
!folder/important_file.txt
•	Ignore files with a specific extension:    *.bak
15. To see who changed a particular line in a file
•	git blame login.js

16. Git stash
# You modified files A and B, but not committed them.
git stash             # saves changes and reverts to clean state
git switch another-branch
# do something else...
git switch main
git stash apply       # brings back your changes
17. To check branch is merge 
•	git branch –merged

If branch not merged then displays its name

18. To Delete multiple local branches at once

•	git branch –d branc1 branch2 branch3

LAB ACTION PLAN FOR WEEK 3
Objective: 
1.	To work on collaborative coding by:
a.	Creating Organization.
b.	Coordinating with others through a shared repository
2.	To resolve conflicts when collaborating on same part of code.
3.	To create and apply patch 
4.	Students need to make note in observation book and also upload the screenshots of above executed exercise and scenario-based question. 
1.	Collaborative coding.
Code collaboration refers to the process of multiple people working together on the same codebase.
There are two ways of collaborative coding:
a.	Creating Organization
b.	Coordinating with others through a shared repository

a.	Facilitating Collaborative Work by creating Organization
Organization - Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features. Steps to facilitate collaborative work by creating organization are:
Step 1:  Click on New organization in Git hub
            Click on Create a free organization.
Step 2:  Set up your organization by entering the details like name, associated email, account verification, etc.
              Click on Next
Step 3:  Complete the setup by 
	adding members to the group.
	Now, the invitation goes to other collaborator and they must accept.
	Next click on complete setup
	Goto Github and click on 
      Settings  Member privileges  Base permissions  Select write  change base permission to “Write”  

 Next under,
   Projects base permissions  Select Write  change base permission to “Write”  

Step 4:  Create the remote repository for storing the project related files in Organization.  This repository is accessible to every member of the team as per the permissions given.
Note: The repository can be made private so that it is accessible only to the group members rather than being in a public domain.
Now all the members of the team can contribute to the development of the project and the different files with all the versions and modification notices will be available in the respective repositories and is accessible to all the members
b.	To collaborate effectively on GitHub shared repository by sharing code and coordinating with others through a shared repository.

    Steps for Collaborator 1 are:  (collaborator-1 has repository that he wants to share with 
         collaborator-2)
	       Go to Settings > collaborators
	Now in Manage Access click on Add people
	Now you will be able to see ONE collaborator added
	After this invitation goes to collaborator 2 and they need to accept it.

  Steps for Collaborator 2 are:

	✅ 1. Set Up Git and GitHub
In git bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com

            Note : run $ git remote -v
                      If origin  git@github.com:OrgYOG/commonREPO.git (fetch)
 origin  git@github.com:OrgYOG/commonREPO.git (push)
            then
	
            $ git remote –v // Note now, not connected to any remote


✅ 2. Goto Git hub and copy url of shared repository by collaborator 1
	
•	Copy url (option 1)

✅ 3. Clone the Repository
Get a local copy of the repo:
	In git bash
	git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
	cd repository-name

✅ 4. Create a Branch for Your Work
Always work on a separate branch:
In git bash
	git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

✅ 5. Make Changes and Commit
Edit files, then stage and commit your changes:
In git bash to existing file / new file  
	git add .	
	git commit -m "Add a clear and descriptive commit message"

✅ 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub
	In git bash
	git push origin feature/your-feature-name
✅ 7.  Keep Your Branch Updated (has to be done by owner collaborator 1)
Before making new changes:
In git bash
	git checkout main
	git pull origin main
	git checkout feature/your-new-feature
	git merge main


Exercise on Fork
•	If you're contributing to an existing project:  (in public repository  say of Person1)
•	Note: Person 1means other public repository already exit that is pushed by person 1.
           Person 2 is you who want to contribute.

Note: Following steps needed if you forked from any public repository to contribute to Person 1

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Person1/awesome-project` (of Person 1)
2. Click the “Fork” button at the top-right of the page.
3. GitHub will create a copy of that repository in your account (say Person2):

       https://github.com/your-username/awesome-project
as
         https://github.com/Person2/awesome-project

4. Clone your forked repo: in bash (by Person 2) 
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesome-project
	Make changes.
	git add .
	 git Commit 
	git push origin main
  
5.	Create or  a “pull request” back to the original repo (`othername/awesome-project) to suggest your changes. (by Person 2)

	Click at top “Pull request” or click on  at top or click on repo “awesome-project” then click on Contribute at top then click on “open pull request”
	Add title and Add a description if you want. Below it shows what changes you made to file  
	Click on Create pull request

Now you see on page message “NO conflicts with base branch”
✅ 6.  By Person 1
•	Pull requests 1  appears at top in git hub account of Person 1 
•	Clicking on “Pull requests” shows: 
   Commit by Person 2. Click on this commit message.
   It redirect to repository (say awesome-project)
•	Click on “File changed 1” to see changes made by Person 2
•	Click on “Review Changes”, add review and  click on “submit review”
•	Click on Merge pull request
•	Confirm merge
   
Note:  It displays “Pull request Successfully merged and closed” to Person 1

•	Now go to Code and see changes have been merged to the file. 
•	In commit it shows: Commit by Person 2
                                 Merge commit by Person 1

✅ 7.  Merge the Pull Request (has to be done by both collaborators)
Once approved:
•	The repo owner can click Merge pull request

✅ 8.  Keep Your Branch Updated (has to be done by Person 1 and Person 2)
Before making new changes:
In git bash
	git checkout main
	git pull origin main
	git checkout feature/your-new-feature
	git merge main
	cd repository-name


2.	To resolve conflicts when collaborating on same part of code.
Resolving conflicts when collaborating with GitHub (or Git in general) is a normal part of team development. Conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same part of the code, and Git doesn't know which version to keep.
✅ Steps to Resolve a Conflict
1. See Which Files Are in Conflict (Say f1.txt)
In git bash
	git status
   Conflicted files will be marked like:
In git bash
	both modified:  (Say f1.txt)
________________________________________
3.	Open the File and Look for Conflict Markers by clicking on

	Click on Resolve Conflict

Git will insert conflict markers in the file like this:
def greet():
<<<<<<< HEAD
    print("Hello from First collaborator ")
=======
    print("Hello from second collaborator ")
>>>>>>> feature/second collaborator branch
This shows the two conflicting changes:
•	HEAD is your version
•	The section below ======= is the other branch’s version or second collaborator branch version
________________________________________
3. Edit the File to Fix the Conflict
	Choose one version or combine them:
	def greet():
   	     print("Hello from First collaborator ")
                    print("Hello from second collaborator ")
	Then delete all the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
________________________________________
4. Mark the Conflict as Resolved
Once you've edited and saved the file:
	git add f1.txt
________________________________________
5. Complete the Merge or Pull
	git commit    # Only needed if you're merging
Or if you're rebasing:
	git rebase --continue
________________________________________
⚠️ If You Want to Abort the Merge
If it gets messy and you want to cancel:
git merge --abort
________________________________________

Here below screen shot shows conflict raised when collaborator 1 wanted to merge changes to same line that already collaborator 2 added the line of code at that line  in same file but in their own branch. 

Example :
             Merge Conflict – Changes made to a file by two different users leads to merge conflict as below.
Say I am collaborator 2, now
	Accept invitation from collaborator 1
	Next goes to Shared repository by collaborator 1 (say abcrepo)
	Now open Git bash and clone the shared repo as below steps
Step 1: first connect to this “abcrepo” to local repository by clone
	Now change directory to “abcrepo”
	Switch to branch feature-abc
	Now add line in README.md file
	Now git add, commit
	Now see status and push to remote branch feature-abc
	Now go to Github and refresh or click on “abcrepo”, you can see  README.md
Step 2: Now collaborator 2 adding line in README.md, save, git add, commit,  push. No conflicts
Step 3: Also collaborator 1 adding line in README.md at same line collaborator 2 added, then git add, commit, push gives merge conflict. 
NOTE IMPORTANT :
Now collaborator 2 has to give git pull command then open conflicting file to see conflict markers.
Now Edit the File to Fix the Conflict by keeping either or both collaborator changes and remove conflict markers. Add file, commit, and push. 
3.	To create and apply patch 
A patch in Git is a text file that represents changes between two sets of files, or commits. It's essentially the output of the git diff command, packaged in a format that can be applied to another set of files.

Steps:
1.	Goto github and take public project url

2.	Clone into git bash

3.	Now open file and edit it, add, commit

4.	Run git log 

5.	Create patch with commit hash code as:

git format-patch -1 commit-hash-code

           This creates 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch file.

Note: git format-patch -1 <commit-hash>
•	-1 means "create a patch from 1 commit"
•	This creates a .patch file for a single commit.
•	Example:
				
git format-patch -1 abc1234
•	This creates a file like 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
To create patches for the last 3 commits: git format-patch -3 

	or
Create patches from multiple commits
	git format-patch <base_commit>..HEAD


6.	Get the path of above patch file and email or what’s up to the remote owner of file.

7.	 Once the remote owner gets the patch file 0001-commit-from-cloned-person.patch next the owner need to apply patch file in his git bash  using git command below:

	Syntax:
		git apply my-changes.patch
                 	  Or, if it's a patch made by git format-patch, use:
		git am 0001-Your-commit-message.patch  

	git apply 0001-Your-commit-message.patch
