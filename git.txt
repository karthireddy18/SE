Task 1: Pushing multi-folder project into private repository( Note: student take screenshots for upload).
1. Create a Private Repository on GitHub
•	Go to https://github.com
•	Click 
•	New repository
•	Give it a name
•	Check Private
•	Click Create repository
 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Project (if not already done)
     Open a terminal in the root of your multi-folder project:
  	cd /path/to/your/project
  	git init
3. Add the Remote Repository (in bash)
You’ll see a URL on GitHub after creating the repo. It will look as below , run  this command in git bash:
	git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-private-repo.git
4. Add and Commit Your Files(in bash)
	git add .
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. Push to the Private Repository 
If the repo is new and empty, push like this from git bash:
	git push -u origin master
If you're using the main branch (GitHub default):
	git push -u origin main
You may be prompted to log in (via username/password or token).

Task 2: Students must explore all listed git commands on the multi-folder project in local and remote repository.
1.	Git  Commands:
●	git version : The command git version is used to check the version of git. 
git --version
•	git config: Configures Git settings. Commonly used to set up user information
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
•	git config --list: Displays all the Git configurations for the current user.
2.	 Repository Management
•	git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
git init
•	git clone:  Creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a remote source (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine
	git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
•	git remote –v : To see the remote repository that is connected to your local repository
 git remote –v

•	git remote add : To add a new remote repository to your local repository
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git


•	Pushing Changes to Remote: To push your local commits to a remote repository:

         git push <remote_name> <branch_name>

		git push origin main

•	Pulling Updates from Remote: To pull the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch
          git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>

          git pull origin main


•	git remote remove: To remove a remote repository from your local configuration:

            git remote remove <remote_name>

         git remote remove origin
•	Renaming a Remote:  to rename an existing remote: 

         git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>

	  git remote rename origin upstream

•	Fetching Updates from Remote: To fetch updates from the remote repository but not merge them into your local branch

	git fetch <remote_name>

•	Changing Remote URL : To change the URL of a remote (e.g., after changing the remote repository address):
	git remote set-url <remote_name> <new_url>

            git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repository.git

•	Viewing the Remote Repository’s Information: to see detailed information about a remote repository

            git remote show <remote_name>

            git remote show origin


3. Staging and Committing
•	git status: Shows the status of changes in your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files are untracked, modified, or ready to be committed.
git status
•	git add: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
git add filename.txt   # Adds a specific file
git add .              # Adds all changes in the directory
•	git commit: Commits the staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message. The -m option allows you to include a commit message.
git commit -m "Commit message describing changes"
4. Branching and Merging
•	git branch: Lists all branches or creates a new branch
git branch                # Lists all branches or
git branch -a               # Lists all branches
git branch branch-name    # Creates a new branch
git branch -d <branch_name>    # Deletes a branch
                        Use -D to force-delete if it hasn't been merged.
•	Listing All Remote Branches :  To you want to list all branches on the remote repository
         git branch –r

•	git checkout: Switches to a different branch
git checkout branch-name  # Switches to an existing branch
git checkout -b new-branch # Creates and switches to a new branch
•	Pruning Deleted Remotes : If a branch was deleted on the remote but still shows up locally.
   git remote prune origin

When someone deletes a branch on the remote, your local Git doesn’t automatically remove the corresponding remote-tracking branch (like origin/old-feature).
git remote prune origin removes these outdated references.

•	Fetching a Specific Remote Branch: To fetch a specific branch from a remote.
     git fetch <remote_name> <branch_name>

	    git fetch origin feature-branch

•	Setting the Upstream Branch for Pushing : When pushing for the first time and want to set the remote branch you are pushing to:

	git push --set-upstream <remote_name> <branch_name>

       git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch

•	git merge: Merges the specified branch into the current branch. This command integrates the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.
git checkout main         # Switch to the main branch
git merge branch-name     # Merge branch-name into main
•	Rebasing a Local Branch onto a Remote Branch: If you want to rebase your local branch onto a remote branch (this can be useful to keep your history linear)
	git fetch <remote_name>
	git rebase <remote_name>/<branch_name>
Example:
	git fetch origin
	git rebase origin/main

5.	Undoing Changes

•	git reset : Removes the specified file from the staging area but leaves the working directory unchanged. git reset --hard can also reset the working directory and staging area to the last commit.
git reset <file>:
•	git revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specified commit, leaving the history intact.
git revert <commit>:
6.	Viewing History

•	git log: Shows a history of commits in the repository, including commit hashes, messages, and timestamps. Use git log --oneline for a more concise view.
		git log:
•	git diff: Displays differences between various commits, the working directory, and the staging area. git diff without arguments shows changes not yet staged.
git diff:
•	git show:  Shows the details of a specific commit, including the changes made and the commit message.
git show <commit>
7.	To undo the changes made to file before staging it.

•	git restore filename
8.	To correct committed with the wrong message
•	git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"

9. Recovering deleted branches

•	git reflog
•	git checkout -b feature-ui <commit_hash>

10. To download the latest changes from the remote without merging
•	git fetch origin

11. To remove accidentally committed  sensitive file from Git history.

•	git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
•	"git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch secrets.txt" \
•	--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

12. To merge changes from another branch
First switch to branch where changes are to applied and then merge another-branch
•	git checkout previous-branch
•	git merge another-branch

13. To resolve a merge conflict manually
You tried to merge two branches and Git reported a conflict in x.js. Then for conflict resolution do:
1.	Open x.js and resolve/remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
2.	After resolving:
	git add app.js
	git commit  # If Git didn’t auto-create a merge commit

14. The .gitignore
The .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. It's a useful way to avoid committing unnecessary files like log files, build outputs, and IDE configurations. 
a.	 Create a .gitignore File
In the root directory of your Git project, create a file called .gitignore 
touch .gitignore
b.	 Add Rules to .gitignore
Inside the .gitignore file, you add patterns for the files and directories you want Git to ignore. Each pattern should be written on a new line.
Here are some common examples:
•	Ignore all .log files:    *.log
•	Ignore a specific file:     secret_file.txt
•	Ignore all files in a temp/ directory:        temp/
•	Ignore all files except important_file.txt inside a folder:
folder/*
!folder/important_file.txt
•	Ignore files with a specific extension:    *.bak
15. To see who changed a particular line in a file
•	git blame login.js

16. Git stash
# You modified files A and B, but not committed them.
git stash             # saves changes and reverts to clean state
git switch another-branch
# do something else...
git switch main
git stash apply       # brings back your changes
17. To check branch is merge 
•	git branch –merged

If branch not merged then displays its name

18. To Delete multiple local branches at once

•	git branch –d branc1 branch2 branch3
